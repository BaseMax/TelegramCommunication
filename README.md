# Telegram Communication Javascript (JS)

## Telegram Javascript (JS)

We don't work for money and prizes, We do this for science only. (Because the telegram had set a gift for this)

### Run

Run from the http server to demonstrate the proposed software structure then watch **browser logs**.

### Sample Output
  
```
data to server 180

parsed data >>data to parse Server answer 132 8

```

## Telegram Server addresses

You should change the telegram server address to X: (MIGRATE_X)

    Server 1: 149.154.175.50:443
    Server 2: 149.154.167.51:443
    Server 3: 149.154.175.100:443
    Server 4: 149.154.167.91:443
    Server 5: 91.108.56.165:443

## Telegram Contest

The Telegram contest for JavaScript developers is starting today. 

- Prize fund of the first stage: $80,000+.
- Prize fund of all 3 stages:  $200,000+.  
- Dates: Nov 3 - Nov 17 (23:50 Dubai time).

The goal is create a simplified web version of Telegram without using third-party UI frameworks. The app should include login/signup flows and allow viewing chat and message lists. The design implementation should be identical to the mockups attached below.

You are welcome to view the API docs (https://core.telegram.org/#telegram-api) and inspect the source code of existing Telegram apps (https://telegram.org/apps#source-code) to get an idea of where to start. The main criteria for us to identify the winners will be the speed, size and attention to detail of their apps. Implementation of additional screens from the mockups (e.g. message creation, media viewer, shared media, settings etc) will be counted as bonus points. Apps without basic functionality (i.e. login/signup and chat/message lists) will not be awarded. All the paths in the scripts should be relative. 

For avoidance of doubt, using UI frameworks such as React and Angular is not allowed. Using data frameworks such as tdlib is possible in theory, but is likely to result in unacceptable increase in loading times compared to plain JS solutions.

The authors of the best apps will share the $80,000+ prize fund and will be able to take part in stage 2.  

We will publish the instruction on how to submit the apps soon. Good luck!
